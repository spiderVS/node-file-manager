# File-manager

A simple but functional file manager :)

The file manager is able to perform the following operations:

- Perform basic file operations (copy, move, delete, rename, etc.);
- Get information about the host machine operating system;
- Perform hash calculations;
- Compress and decompress files(Brotli algorithm).

To see all supported commands after launching the file manager, please type `help`.

## Start application

To start the application you should use **18 LTS** version of Node.js.

1. Go to folder `file-manager`.
2. Start file-manager by npm-script:
```javascript
npm run start -- --username=your_username
```

  > `your_username` - Your preferred name
  >
  > for example:

P.S. Thanks for using my application ;)
